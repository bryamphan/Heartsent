            Dear Marc,<br><br>
            I'm so happy to be celebrating our first Valentine's day together. 
            I still think about how weird it was that we came across each other, 
            and what a strange time it was when we met. A year ago from today, 
            I would have never thought that this would happen to me, but I 
            couldn't ask for any less. I wish I was there with you in person 
            to celebrate, it sucks that we're split through a screen. But, 
            there's nothing that I would change about what we have right now, 
            and I'm so incredibly grateful to have you. I'm sorry this is so
            last minute, and this definitely didn't turn out the way I wanted it
            to, but I hope you love it. I still miss you everyday, I think about
            you constantly, and I still get butterflies in my stomach sometimes
            when I talk to you, like how I felt when I first met you. Love you so much,
            can't wait to see you soon!<br><br>
            Love,<br>
            Bryan
